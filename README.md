Automated Data Processing with JavaScript Scripting


This code demonstrates how you can use JavaScript to process data from a CSV file and fetch data from an external API using npm packages like csv-parser and axios, respectively. You would need to install these packages using npm (npm install csv-parser axios) before running the code.

Please note that this is a basic example, and you would need to customize the data processing logic within the functions processDataFromCSV and fetchDataFromAPI according to your specific requirements. Additionally, you may want to implement error handling, logging, and other features as described in the project description.
